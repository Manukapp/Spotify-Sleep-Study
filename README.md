# Spotify Sleep Study - Research Tool

This repository contains Python scripts developed for a PhD research study at the **Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research, UK**. The study investigates the relationship between musical structure and sleep quality in dementia caregivers.

## Features:
- Extracts **Spotify track metadata** (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.) using the API.
- Organizes data into **CSV files** for statistical analysis.
- Used strictly for **academic research** (not a commercial application).

## Data Compliance:
- No **personal user data** is collected or stored.
- The API is used **solely for analyzing track features**.
- All research findings acknowledge **Spotify's data contribution**.

## How It Works:
1. Run `get_spotify_data.py` to fetch track features.
2. The script saves data into `Classify_Spotify_Tracks_16_01_v.py`.
3. Statistical analysis is performed using Python and SPSS.
